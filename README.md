# JS_Micro_Ejercicios

## What did the exercise consist of?

Given a series of statements (all of them commented in each app.js file), I made different prompts, functions and loops to solve these exercises (each one ordered in its respective folder). Each step and function performed in the exercises is commented at the request of the teacher to explain how we have solved it.

## How does each exercise work?

(the exercises could be performed with different methods, these are the ones I have used)

In most exercises, a dialog box will appear on the screen with a text specifying what the exercise requires (sentences or numbers, in this case). Once the required data has been entered in the dialog boxes, depending on whether the requirements have been met or not, one message or another will be printed on the screen. In this case, we would be talking about exercises that consist of counting vowels, determining which vowels appear in a given sentence, finding prime numbers, divisors...

## Organization of exercises

Everything consists of a 'mother' folder named 'src', inside this big folder we will find other mini folders, each one specified with the number of the exercise. Inside each mini folder, we will find 3 files. An html file with the basic structure and the link to a js file, the js file itself where each exercise will be developed and a css file that in this case, will be empty. The exercise does not require it, but in case it is necessary, the css file would be linked in case it needs to be used for styling.
